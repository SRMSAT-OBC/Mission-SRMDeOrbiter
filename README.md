SRMSAT has decided a new mission- mission for removing/making a satellite that will remove itself within a span of 25 years(According to new space laws that outdated satellites must ,instead of being pushed to the graveyard orbit-which is just outside of geostatationary orbit, to be sent back to earth within 25 years). The main responsibilty for this project lies within OBC itself, because of current absence of any other modules other than spectrometer and few others. The repository is created for sharing of code relative to the mission.
